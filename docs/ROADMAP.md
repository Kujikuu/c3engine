# Roadmap

Status keys: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

## M0: Setup
- [x] Rust stable MSVC toolchain installed (rustc 1.99.1)
- [x] Workspace scaffold + docs
- [x] Local CI: `scripts/check.ps1` (fmt --check, clippy -D warnings, tests)

## M1: TQ formats [x] (complete 2026-10-18) (`formats/c3`)
Reference assets: `D:\Conquer2\Tools\eosource\client5065`
- [x] WDF package read + write (byte-identical on c3.wdf, data.wdf)
- [x] DNP package: n/a, no .dnp files in the 5065 client
- [x] DDS (DXT1/3/5, raw) + TGA decode: all 20,144 packed DDS decode
- [x] ClientFs VFS (loose files first, then WDF) + `mapshot` example (map ground → PNG)
- [x] MSK masks, TME terrain effects, RGN regions
- [x] ANI index files (51 files / 56,971 sections; GBK-safe; frame paths resolve in WDF)
- [x] ini tables, .scene/.Part terrain objects, GameMap.dat, all game .dat tables (incl. XorRot-encrypted)
- [x] DMap (cells, heights, portals, interactive + scene layers): 144/144 client maps byte-identical
- [x] PUL puzzle (143/143 byte-identical; every used tile resolves in its ANI)
- [x] C3 chunks: PHY, MOTI, SHAP, SMOT, PTCL, CAME
- [x] Round-trip tests on real client files for every format (`formats/c3/tests/real_files.rs`)

## Course correction (2026-10-18), see DECISIONS.md
- [x] (1) `engine/scene` + `engine/assets` + TQ importer/exporter: 144/144 maps round-trip
- [x] (2) Studio edits engine `Scene`s; TQ access isolated in `studio/src/tq_plugin.rs`
- [x] (3) C3 models: container + PHY + MOTI (incl. XKEY), engine `c3-anim` Clip/skinning and
      `c3_assets::model`, TQ importer `model_io`; all 4,516 files verified; `modelshot` renders posed models
- [x] (3b) Typed SHAP/SMOT/PTCL/CAME (PTCX/PTC3 absent in 5065)
- [x] (3c) Remaining M1 tables and formats
- [x] (4) M2 renderer: `engine/render` (wgpu 30) with sprite + lit mesh passes into offscreen targets
      (headless GPU test). Studio ground and the new Models workspace render through it

## Next
- [ ] Draw map scene objects (cover/scene sprites from ANI) so maps look complete
- [ ] Character assembly in `games/conquer` (look + armor/armet/weapon parts + 3dmotion), previewed in Studio
- [ ] Game client app (`apps/client`): winit window presenting `c3-render`, map + walking hero

## M2: Renderer
- [x] wgpu window + camera: `apps/client` (winit 0.30 + surface), drag/WASD pan, wheel zoom, fit;
      content via `games/conquer::Content`; shared `c3_render::ground` streaming (180 fps on Twin City)
- [x] Puzzle ground + map layers (classic iso): cover sprites + terrain prefabs from ANI with the
      classic footprint draw order (`c3_scene::draw_order`), frame animation, parallax sky/water layers
      with scroll; engine `SpriteSet`/`Prefab` assets, `c3_render::{objects, parallax}` behind `SceneAssets`
- [x] Skinned C3 meshes with armor/weapon layering: actors in the 2D world (classic role transform +
      ortho camera, painter's order with map objects via depth slices); Conquer character assembly
      (`games/conquer::character`: armor/armet(hair)/weapon tables, weapon family, body + weapon
      motions with fallbacks, socket attachment `Role·Bone0`). Mounts: Mount.ini is a stub in 5065
- [x] Effects: engine `Effect` asset (layers of keyed meshes, baked particles, ribbon trails;
      per-layer texture + blend; delay/loop clock), TQ importer (`3DEffect.ini` + `3DEffectObj.ini`),
      `c3_render::effect` playback (billboards, camera-facing particles, 30 ms trail steps), blend-mode
      pipelines; map effect entities play in the client, `--effect NAME` previews any effect.
      Next: effects bound to actors (level-up, weapon trails on sockets) sharing the actor's depth
- [x] Map + character viewer app: `apps/client` hero (default player or `--player`/`--actor`)
      walks where you click: `c3_scene::path` A* (8 directions, blocked cells, climb ≤ 25,
      nearest-cell fallback), one cell per walk/run action eased over frames × `Action.dat`
      interval (walk 500 ms, run 200 ms per cell), R toggles run, camera follows (Space)

## M3: Studio v1
- [x] Studio shell (eframe/egui): toolbar, map list, inspector, status bar, theme, shortcuts
- [x] Map viewer: streamed ground tiles at client-exact placement, cell grid, blocked cells,
      portals (jump-to), objects, hover inspector, fit/zoom/pan
- [x] Map editing: Block / Walkable brush (1–21 cells), portal add/move/delete, undo/redo
      (strokes merge into one step), Save (Ctrl+S) with atomic write + first-save `.bak`,
      unsaved-changes guard on map switch and quit
- [ ] Draw scene objects (cover/scene ANI sprites) so maps look complete
- [ ] Project system (open/save game project)
- [ ] Asset browser (packages, textures, models)
- [ ] Map editor (cells, objects, portals, export DMap + Redux tinymap/SQL)
- [ ] Model / animation viewer

## M4: Conquer game module
- [ ] 5065 cipher + packet framework
- [ ] Login / account server → game server
- [ ] Spawn, walk, jump, other players, NPCs
- [ ] Combat, items, UI parity

## M5: Data + scripting
- [ ] Data tables editor (items, skills, monsters)
- [ ] Scripting host; gameplay without recompiling
- [ ] Prove generality: a tiny second sample game

## M6: Ship
- [ ] Asset packaging, client build, launcher/patcher
- [ ] glTF import/export (Blender pipeline) for models + animations
